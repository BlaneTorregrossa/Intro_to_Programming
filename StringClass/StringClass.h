//Creating a string class.
//Include comments that describes how the program works.

//Query the string's length and return an interger.
//Access a character at a certain index within the string class.
//Compare if the string is the same as another string class.
//Append one string to another.
//Prepend one string to another.
//Return the string as a basic constant C-style string (const char*).
//Convert the string to a duplicate containing all lowercase letters.
//Convert the string to a duplicate containing all uppercase letters.
//Find a sub-string within the string class.
//Find a sub-string within the string class, starting from a certain index within the string.
//Replace a sub-string found within the string with a different sub-string.
//Set the string to an input C-style string.
